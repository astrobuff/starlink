#  Name:
#     Gaia3dVtkOutline

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Outline prop for cubes.

#  Description:
#     Class to create instances of a vtkOutlineFilter and provide
#     methods to manage the related work required to render it
#     in a scene and provide the ability to fix it to the bounds
#     of a vtkImageData instance (cube).
