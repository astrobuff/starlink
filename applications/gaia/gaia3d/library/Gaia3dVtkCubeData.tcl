#  Name:
#     Gaia3dVtkCubeData

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Wrapper class for accessing vtkImageData instances.

#  Description:
#     Accesses the cube data in a instance of GaiaNDArray and makes
#     it available as a vtkImageData instance. Also provides facilities
#     for creating a sub-volume of the cube and handles the changes
#     to the world coordinate and apparent size.
