#  Name:
#     Gaia3dVtkPrism

#  Type of Module:
#     [incr Tcl] class

#  Purpose:
#     Base class for creating and manipulating prisms.

#  Description:
#     Base class to create instances of a vtkPolyData that represent the
#     extrusion of a 2D shape into a third dimension and provide methods to
#     manage the related work required to render it in a scene and provide the
#     ability to fix to the given bounds or axis of a vtkImageData instance
#     (cube). This is extended for specific shapes by implementing a
#     create_polygon_ method that describes the 2D locus of the shape.
